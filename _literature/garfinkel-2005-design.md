    In his PhD thesis, Garfinkel takes the view that there is no inherent conflict between security and user-friendliness in the development of systems and that synergies can be exploited in the (re-)design of the systems. In particular, he presents six principles and about 20 patterns that make it possible to better harmonize security and usability in the design of systems.
